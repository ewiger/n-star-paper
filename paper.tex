  \begin{abstract}
    This paper proposes Set Theory models \( N \) of \( ZF + DC \) that explicitly decides the Continuum Hypothesis ($CH$) as well as \( N^\ast \) of \( ZF + DC_\lambda + I \) that implies the existence of \textit{supercompact cardinal}. The approach employs advanced and somewhat novel techniques from mathematical logic, including Boolean-valued models and String Enumeration Formulas (SEF) to build \textit{replicata} structures as used for the models. It follows that $CH$ becomes resolved for all instances of large enough models of \( ZF + DC \), providing a concrete solution to a longstanding open problem, so that Goedel's conjecture $2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_2$ holds. Other results offer new insights into the structure of \( N^\ast \) and its implications for related mathematical theories, laying a foundation for further research on infinite sets.
